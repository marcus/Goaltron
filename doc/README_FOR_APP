Welcome to Goaltron!

Here's how to get quickly started with your own local copy:
1) create dabatase goaltron_development, (set your database.yml appropriately)
2) rake db:migrate
3) ruby script/setup
4) ruby script/server
voila!

Check the models/ in this directory for some details on how this app works.

The models with any complication in them:
	daily_day_entry : Each row is one user's day in the db
	daily_goal : A users defined goals

The controllers:
	daily_day_entries_controller : Manages clicking the stars on the main /daily page
	daily_goals_controller : Manages the "change goals" page...

Run "rake appdoc" to generate API documentation for the models and controllers.
