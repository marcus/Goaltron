= Acts As Dismissible

Allows you to create messages in the user interface, which the users can dismiss once read.
The plugin stores the reference to the dismissed message in a cookie.

= Usage Examples

  # Add a dismissible message to the view:

<% dismissible_message('site_welcome') do -%>
<p> Hello and welcome to our site. I hope you enjoy your stay. Feel free to look around.</p>
<% end -%>

  # Produces:
  <div class="dismissible_message" id="hide_dismissible_site_welcome">
    <p> Hello and welcome to our site. I hope you enjoy your stay. Feel free to look around.</p>
    <p>
      <a class="dismissible_link" href="#" onclick="document.cookie = 'hide_dismissible_site_welcome = 1; expires= Sun, Jan 17 2038 11:14:06 UTC; path=/';document.getElementById('hide_dismissible_site_welcome').style.display = 'none'; return false;">Don't show this again.</a>
    </p>
  </div>
  
  # Add A custom message
  <% dismissible_message('site_welcome', { :message => "Do not show this again" }) do -%>
  <p> Hello and welcome to our site. I hope you enjoy your stay. Feel free to look around.</p>
  <% end -%>
  
  # Only display this message if a previous dismissible message was dismissed.
  <% dismissible_message('cookie_two', { :message => "Do not show this again", :follows => "cookie_one" }) do -%>
  <p>Why did you dismiss the last message?</p>
  <% end -%>

= Extra Credit

The cookie implementation for this plugin is based off ideas from Court3 and DanP.
Rick Olson also helped clean up some of this code to make it more succinct.
