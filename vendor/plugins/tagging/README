= Tagging

Tagging, as you can probably guess, is a plugin for Ruby On Rails that allows
you to support tags on any of your application's models.  This tagging plugin
takes the best ideas from the existing folksonomy plugins and adds controller
and view support for editing and an API that is crazy easy to use.

== Quick Start

 # Update your database schema
 ./script/generate tagging add_taggings
 rake db:migrate

 # Add some tagging magic to a model
 class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_taggable
 end

 # Add some tag editing methods to your controller
 class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
   tagging_helper_for Article
 end

 # Add a tag cloud and tag editor to your view
 <h1>Tags: <%= tag_editor_for(@article) %></h1>
 <%= tag_cloud_for(@article) %>

 # Work with tags from ./script/console
 article.tags.add("ruby pmade")
 article.tags.remove("python")
